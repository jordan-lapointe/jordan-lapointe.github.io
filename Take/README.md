This project is an implementation of a free layout design found on Behance.

This page was created as part of my study on HTML5 and responsive design. Every line of code was hand-written; no page generators were used.

I used HTML5's "semantic tags" where appropriate, a recommended practice for screen-reader compatibility and code readability.

For stylesheet development I used SASS, a variant of CSS with more sophisticated syntax features.
