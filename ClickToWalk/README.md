I made this project to experiment with several features of Godot, a free and open-source game engine.

* Importing a 3D character rig from Blender.
* Character movement based on clicked location.
* Collision with environmental objects.

The character model was downloaded from https://quaternius.com/packs/ultimatedanimatedcharacter.html.
